            I am a 27yr old who has a hard time explaining what he does, So lets just say a handiman.
            I work on machines, cars, can wire a house, build you a shed, build furniture or cabinets, 
            and hopefully soon can build you a decent website. <em>Hopefully better than this one!</em>

        <P>
            This is my first attempt at hardcoding a website using html. I am using the application VS Code to compile this simple page.
            Though silly, the goal is to build something that would be a usable informational page with pictures and vidoes included.
